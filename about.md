# About us

This project and our team are dedicated to help you with prototyping your idea of IoT device.

## Our competitive advantages

* Expertise
* Price
* Speed
* Examples
* Open-source code
* Customizable prototypes

We have a vast expertise in embedded design and development with combined 15 years of C/C++ programming for different architectures and using versatile environments and tools.

To provide our clients with highly sophisticated and powerful solution and to decrease R&D period we propose our own HW and SW solutions that we can customize quite rapidly to meet specific needs of our customers.

Having R&D center in Ukraine (the best outsourcing location in Europe) we are able to provide highly competitive prices combined with access to highly skilled professionals.

We built our SW software development kit (SDK) around real-time operating system for embedded devices called Chibios. As a result we are able to create firmware with sophisticated architecture and thanks to Chibios hardware abstraction layer changing a microprocessor is just a matter of changes in few lines of code.
We use ARM Cortex M3 and M4 series from STM to make our solutions powerful and energy efficient while maintaining a low price for a final product. These 32-bit MCUs are game-changers for IoT field as far as provide such capabilities as vast RAM, high clock frequency, DMA channels and peripherals like DAC/ADC, I2C, SPI, UART controllers.

## Target audience

* IoT startups
* IoT businesses
* Embedded startups
* Embedded businesses

Our goal is to provide technical expertise and vision for IoT startups from Silicon Valley, Israel, Europe, etc. We are helping our customers to simplify and shorten a path from an idea to a successful product that changes the world.

To prove our abilities we will describe our embedded platform using guides and datasheets, as well as presentations of working prototypes for common use cases.

## Applications

* Smart house
* Smart city
* Remote monitoring
* Asset tracking
* Resource monitoring
* Security
* Agriculture
* 
Our solution and services enable our customers from different application fields to quickly move from idea to prototype and from prototype to the production.

We support GSM/GPRS, GPS, bluetooth, gyroscope modules out of the box. We are working to constantly extend number of modules that our firmware supports. Making it just a matter of configuration to use any number of them in a combination that is required for a specific product.

We are open to add support for any existing module that speaks UART, SPI, I2C or any other protocol which could be attached to STM microprocessors.
