</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a vast expertise in embedded design and development with combined 15 years of C/C++ programming for different architectures and using versatile environments and tools.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide our clients with highly sophisticated and powerful solution and to decrease R&D period we propose our own HW and SW solutions that we can customize quite rapidly to meet specific needs of our customers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having R&D center in Ukraine (the best outsourcing location in Europe) we are able to provide highly competitive prices combined with access to highly skilled professionals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We built our SW software development kit (SDK) around real-time operating system for embedded devices called Chibios. As a result we are able to create firmware with sophisticated architecture and thanks to Chibios hardware abstraction layer changing a microprocessor is just a matter of changes in few lines of code.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We use ARM Cortex M3 and M4 series from STM to make our solutions powerful and energy efficient while maintaining a low price for a final product. These 32-bit MCUs are game-changers for IoT field as far as provide such capabilities as vast RAM, high clock frequency, DMA channels and peripherals like DAC/ADC, I2C, SPI, UART controllers.</span>

	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded businesses</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to provide technical expertise and vision for IoT startups from Silicon Valley, Israel, Europe, etc. We are helping our customers to simplify and shorten a path from an idea to a successful product that changes the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To prove our abilities we will describe our embedded platform using guides and datasheets, as well as presentations of working prototypes for common use cases.</span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our solution and services enable our customers from different application fields to quickly move from idea to prototype and from prototype to the production.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We support GSM/GPRS, GPS, bluetooth, gyroscope modules out of the box. We are working to constantly extend number of modules that our firmware supports. Making it just a matter of configuration to use any number of them in a combination that is required for a specific product.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are open to add support for any existing module that speaks UART, SPI, I2C or any other protocol which could be attached to STM microprocessors.</span>
